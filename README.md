🔍 SQL Murder Mystery Project

Welcome to the SQL Murder Mystery — an engaging data exploration challenge designed to test and showcase your SQL and Python skills. This project investigates a fictional crime using real database querying, and serves as an interactive detective story using structured data.

--Project Overview--

In this project, I used SQLite and pandas in Python to explore a database filled with clues, suspects, and witness statements. The database contains multiple tables such as crime_scene_report, interview, person, and more. The goal is to solve a murder mystery by writing smart queries that reveal the killer's identity, the method, and the motive.

The project is also a fun way to practice:

SQL joins, filters, and aggregations
Working with real relational databases
Data analysis with pandas
